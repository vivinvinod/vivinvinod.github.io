This page is a work-in-progress.

Please take a look at the [Publications](https://vivinvinod.github.io/publications/) section for peer-reviewed and published research.


## Machine Learning Method Development
Developing novel kernel-based regression methods for diverse applications, specifically focusing on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) enhancements to address key challenges. Construction of neural network architectures specifically tailored for predicting electronic structure properties (e.g., forces, energy) with a focus on enforcing physical symmetries and equivariance.

### Multifidelity Methods

Multifidelity methods combine data from different degrees of accuracy.

### Active Learning and Uncertainty Quantification
Designing data sampling techniques to reduce redundancy. Assist in minimizing labelling costs for low-data regimes. Refine models and establish uncertainty bounds for predictions. 


## Applications
Vivin strongly believes that development of methods is only effective if the methods are applied for hands-on cases. The second general area of research is identifying areas of implementation for the diverse methods developed.
