The accurate but fast calculation of quantum chemical (QC) properties such as molecular excited states is still computationally expensive. For many applications, a detailed knowledge of such properties is of key importance thereby demanding high accuracy calculations. Machine learning (ML) methods have reduced the compute cost of such properties in the recent past. However, these bring along a new bottle neck: the cost of generating high accuracy training data. This still remains a challenging issue in the application of ML for QC.
Multifidelity machine learning (MFML) methods provide a respite to this hurdle by requiring very little training data from high accuracies which is combined with cheaper and less accurate data to achieve the accuracy of the costlier level. In this work, some key results which show the reduction of the cost of training data are shown for excitation energies at DFT accuracy. In addition, a novel methodological improvement, optimized MFML (o-MFML) is shown. Some further results are also discussed which establish MFML as a superior method to conventional ML methods employing single fidelity training data sets.
