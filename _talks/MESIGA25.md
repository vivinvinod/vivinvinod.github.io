Machine Learning (ML) has seen great use in the recent years in order to mitigate high cost of solving mathematical models that study reality. Depending on the data they are trained on, ML models can predict either high fidelity (HF) or low fidelity (LF) outputs. The former requires a high amount of computational resources to generate training data while the latter is less accurate. Multifidelity (MF) methods involve the use of statistical techniques to combine HF and LF data resulting in high-accuracy lowcost ML models.
This talk will first introduce the recently developed Multifidelity Machine Learning (MFML) method built with kernel ridge regression aimed at prediction Quantum Chemistry (QC) properties. A cross validation scheme retaining the homogeneous structure of MF training data will be discussed as a model assessment metric. A novel dataadapted optimal combination for MF data, Optimized MFML (o-MFML), will be demonstrated as a robust and accurate successor to MFML. The effect of homogeneous and non-homogeneous MF training data on model accuracy shall be studied for both MFML and o-MFML for the prediction of QC properties including excitation energies which are essential to core life processes such as photosynthesis. Analyses covering data hierarchy and training set structures will be presented as the foundation to the novel high-efficiency Γ-curve technique. Finally, application of these diverse methods for QC such as excitation energy simulations of photosynthetic systems and ground state energy prediction atmospherically relevant molecules will be briefly presented as evidence of real world effectiveness of the herein presented MF methods.
