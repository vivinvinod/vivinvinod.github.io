- Hi, I’m @vivinvinod
- I’m interested in quantum ML, physics, statistics, economic theory (pluralist mostly), reinforcement learning, big data, penetration testing, and food.
- I’m currently learning reinforcement learning tuning on pytorch while working on a multifidelity model for quantum chemistry ML
- Would love to collaborate on any topic that might have substantial long term impact.
- How to reach me: Leave me an e-mail at vinod@uni-wuppertal.de
Cheers
