Machine learning has made significant progress in being used as an augmented tool to progress research in many scientific fields. One such area is the field of quantum chemistry where machine learning methods have been employed to accelerate calculations by replacing high cost quantum chemistry computations with trained machine learning models. While this has significantly reduced the computational resource usage in making new calculations, there still remains the high cost of generating high accuracy, or high fidelity, training data for such models. This new overhead can be mitigated by the use of multifidelity methods which reduces the cost of training data required to achieve a certain model accuracy.This compiled-format dissertation develops and studies the use of multifidelity methods with machine learning for the prediction of quantum chemical properties. The Multifidelity Machine Learning approach is developed as a time-efficient alternative to the single fidelity machine learning methods.
