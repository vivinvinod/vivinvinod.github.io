excerpt: 'This study investigates the impact of modifying γ on model efficiency and accuracy for the prediction of vertical excitation energies using the QeMFi benchmark data set. A novel error metric, error contours of MFML, is proposed to provide a comprehensive view of model error contributions from each fidelity. This is further illustrated through a novel concept, the Gamma-curve, which compares model error against the time-cost of generating training samples, demonstrating that multifidelity models can achieve high accuracy while minimizing training data costs.'
