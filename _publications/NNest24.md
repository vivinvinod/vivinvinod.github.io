title: "Assessing non-nested configurations of multifidelity machine learning for quantum-chemical properties"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/Vinod_Nonnested2024
excerpt: 'This work assesses the use of non-nested training data for two of these multifidelity methods, namely MFML and optimized MFML (o-MFML). The assessment is carried out for the prediction of ground state energies and first vertical excitation energies of a diverse collection of molecules of the CheMFi dataset.'
