This work compares the data costs associated with $\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies, vertical excitation energies, and the magnitude of the electronic contribution of molecular dipole moments from the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of the training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression case.
