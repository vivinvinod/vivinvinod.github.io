excerpt: 'We provide the Quantum chemistry MultiFidelity (QeMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. QeMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties such as vertical excitation properties and molecular dipole moments. Further QeMFi offers QC computation times allowing for a time benefit benchmark of multifidelity models for ML-QC.'
