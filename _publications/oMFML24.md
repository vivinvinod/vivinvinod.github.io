excerpt: 'In this work we implement an optimization procedure to combine multifidelity models in a flexible scheme resulting in optimized MFML (o-MFML) that provides superior prediction capabilities. This work benchmarks the o-MFML method in predicting the atomization energies on the QM7b dataset, and again in the prediction of excitation energies for three molecules of growing size. '
